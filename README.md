# cs330-notes
This repository holds study material for the upcoming final exam in CS330.
I encourage you to collaborate with me, if you need help getting started with Git and/or GitHub let me know.
Please submit changes following the same format with " - " to delimit a term and "\" to delimit a definition.
Definitions can be more than one line, but they must be delimited with "\".
If you study in a different way feel free to fork my notes and customize them as you see fit.
